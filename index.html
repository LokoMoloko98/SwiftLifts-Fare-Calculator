    <h1>Lift Club Weekly Fare Calculator</h1>
    <aside class="explanation">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>This calculator helps you determine your weekly fare if you missed trips/days in the lift club. The fare is calculated based on the number of trips you've taken in a week, considering the type of trip: return or morning-only.</p>
      <p><strong>Rules:</strong> The full weekly fare is expected unless:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you're on a weekly return fare and travel for 60% or less of your trips, you'll be charged per trip at 15% of the weekly fare.</li>
        <li>For a weekly morning-only fare with 60% or fewer trips taken, the charge is per trip at 30% of the weekly fare.</li>
        <li>If no trips are taken during the week, there's no fare.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Simply select your trip type, enter the weekly fare and the number of trips missed to calculate your fare for the week. This is designed to ensure fairness and transparency in how weekly fares are calculated.</p>
